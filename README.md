## College_network
  We are analyzing the social networks of students at the Protestant Higher Education College using network analysis methods. The study focuses on three main types of social relationships (trust, information and dislike networks). The analysis explores how these networks are structured based on gender and DPont (the points system for the participation of social program) categories, a classification system for students.

  The data was collected in 2024 (March 21 to April 21). We prepared a survey merging by different socimetry method. The different networks has different filling number. 

## Research Description
  The primary goal of this research is to analyze the social dynamics among students, focusing on trust, information exchange, and antipathy relationships. The networks were visualized and analyzed based on different structural properties. The network shows clear gender-based segregation, where male and female students form distinct clusters. Higher DPont students tend to form stronger connections, though these clusters are less homogeneous than gender-based ones. 
  The primary objective of this research is to classify participants into clusters based on their program attendance and analyze key patterns within each group.
